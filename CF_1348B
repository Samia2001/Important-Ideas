An array is beautiful if all its subarrays of length k have the same sum.A subarray is given that may not be beautiful.
But we can make it by inserting as many elements as we can. We don't need to minimize the number of inserting elements.
Integers may be inserted anywhere (even before the first or after the last element).If not possible then print -1

1) not possible case - when we have more than k distict elements because we want k similar periods
2) possible case - we will take distict integers and we will insert 1(or any other integers) to fullfil the length k(if we need to add) and let it be a list called b.we will 
repeat the list n times.

ex - 1 1 2 1 3
if k = 4
our single list is
1 2 3 1

we will repeat it n=5 times
1 2 3 1 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 1
